In the wake of that announcement, the community came together in unity and solidarity to remember SynthRose, her work, and her place in our community.
The goal of this mod is to allow SynthRose&amp;rsquo;s memory to live on in her work, and to posthumously complete and maintain her contributions to the fabric modding community.</description></item></channel></rss>
